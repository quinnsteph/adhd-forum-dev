Does anyone have strategies that actually work? I've tried apps, paper planners, sticky notes... but nothing seems to stick.

Would love to hear what's worked for others! ðŸ’™`,

For anyone struggling: I broke it into tiny 15-minute chunks and used the Pomodoro Technique. Also, I told my partner about my deadline so I had some accountability.

Sometimes we need to celebrate the "normal" things that feel huge to us. What small wins are you celebrating today?`,

Anyone else deal with this? How do you cope when the RSD kicks in? I know logically it's not as bad as my brain is making it, but the feelings are so intense.

Could really use some support right now. ðŸ’œ`,

Has anyone been through medication changes? How did you handle the anxiety around it? Any tips for tracking symptoms during the transition?

This feels like such a vulnerable topic but I know this community gets it.`,
